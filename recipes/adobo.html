            <p>Adobo is a popular Filipino dish made with meat, usually chicken or pork, marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. The meat is then simmered until tender and served with rice.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 lbs chicken or pork, cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup vinegar</li>
                <li>1 head garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon peppercorns</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>Cooked rice for serving</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Add the meat and marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the marinated meat (reserve the marinade) and cook until browned on all sides.</li>
                <li>Pour the reserved marinade into the pot with the meat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the meat is tender.</li>
                <li>Adjust seasoning with salt if needed. Serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>You can add potatoes or hard-boiled eggs to the adobo for variation. Some people also like to add coconut milk for a creamier sauce.</p>
